# Vet Clinic Multistep Form

This project is a simple multistep form built using React and TypeScript. It was created as a study project to explore the usage of [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for form handling and validation using [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup). Additionally, [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) is utilized for state management in the application. The UI design is based on the [Pawtastic UI Kit](https://www.behance.net/gallery/62932019/Pawtastic-UI-Kit-for-Adobe-XD) for Adobe XD.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
